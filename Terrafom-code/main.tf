# This file is part of the Terraform with Azure DevOps project.
# This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision AWS resources and deploy the azure hosted client on an EC2 instance.
# The project is designed to be used with Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines. 
# The project includes a main.tf file that defines the AWS resources to be provisioned, including a VPC, security group, and EC2 instance.
# The project also includes a variables.tf file that defines the input variables for the Terraform configuration.
# The project is intended to be used as a starting point for building and deploying applications on AWS using Terraform and Azure DevOps.
